# EmailCraft
## Overview
This project utilizes the OpenAI API to generate realistic email text. It leverages the power of language models provided by OpenAI to produce coherent and contextually relevant email content.

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenAI API
- Langchain (for model implementation)

## Usage
1. **API Access**: Obtain an API key from OpenAI (refer to their documentation for instructions).
2. **Generation**: Utilize the OpenAI API to generate email text based on provided prompts or starting sentences.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the generated email text for coherence, relevance, and language quality.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.
4. Generate email text using the OpenAI API.
5. Evaluate the generated email text for quality and relevance.

## Future Improvements
- Implement user-friendly interfaces for generating and evaluating email text.
- Investigate techniques for controlling the style and tone of generated emails.
